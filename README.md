# Covid-19_Assisstant_App

This project was done during a hackathon organized by WPI to let students come up with creative solutions to make campus Covid Free. The team first did a need assessment considering different problems students might face upon reopening the school in the pandemic. The team then came up with the idea to make an application to solve the problems identified. This app relies on user reported data to keep track of people not following rules & regulation, unsanitized places and a daily log of places visited & people met.
